# Edinburgh Orthodox Site

The Hugo source for https://edinburgh-orthodox.org.uk. It replaces the WordPress.com site,
which is retired once the domain moves (issue #9). Content changes are made here, not in a
WordPress admin.

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
hugo server --source edinburgh-orthodox
```

Open `http://localhost:1313/`. The workflows pin Hugo (extended) version `0.165.0`, so match
that if a build behaves differently on your machine.

## Build and deploy

```sh
hugo --source edinburgh-orthodox --minify
```

The generated static site is written to `edinburgh-orthodox/public/`, which is not committed.
Deployment is automatic: merging into `main` runs `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, which builds
the site and publishes it to GitHub Pages. Every pull request runs
`.github/workflows/hugo.yml`, which builds the site and nothing else. The pre-commit hook in
`lefthook.yml` runs the same build.

## Add a news post

Add a Markdown file directly under `content/news/`, with TOML front matter:

```toml
+++
title = "Parish feast"
date = 2026-09-02
description = "An optional short summary."
draft = false
+++

Write the post here using Markdown.
```

The filename becomes the URL. For example, `parish-feast.md` is published at
`/news/parish-feast/`. Hugo excludes `draft = true` posts from the published build, so a draft
can sit in `main` safely.

For a post with photographs, make a folder of the same name and put the post in it as
`index.md`, next to the images. Then reference them by filename:

```
content/news/parish-feast/
├── index.md
└── procession.jpg
```

```markdown
![The procession leaving Chapel Street](procession.jpg)
```

## Edit site pages

Most pages are plain Markdown files under `content/`:

- `content/clergy.md`
- `content/contact.md`
- Future pages such as `content/history.md`

Structured information is kept in `data/` when a layout needs it:

- `data/churches.yaml` supplies the homepage and Our Churches page.
- `data/services.yaml` supplies the weekly services. It currently holds a sample week.
- `data/announcements.yaml` supplies the weekly announcements.
- `data/wishlist.yaml` supplies wishlist names and prices.
- `data/faq.yaml` supplies the FAQ questions and answers.

Navigation links are defined once in `hugo.toml` under `menus.main`. A link whose page does
not exist yet carries a `TODO` comment in `hugo.toml` and points at `#`; create the page, then
swap the placeholder URL for a `pageRef`.
